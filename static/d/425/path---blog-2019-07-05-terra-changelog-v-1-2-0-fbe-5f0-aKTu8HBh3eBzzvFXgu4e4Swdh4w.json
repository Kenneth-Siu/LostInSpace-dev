This should make rules more intuitive on the results of arming when the target is removed in response.\r\n- **Theat Profiling** and **CEO Umida Koto** had flavour text changed.\r\n- **Rumors and Whispers** reworded for clarity.\r\n- **Mindmeld Torturer** had flavour text added.\r\n- **Leave Behind** reworked again, and had flavour text added.\r\n- **Rip Space-Time** lost the 2 damage to self, gained an exile clause for creatures, and had its teleport cost increased 1R → 2R.\r\n- **Experimental Mutagenics**'s cost reduced 2G → 1G.\r\n- **Publicity Officer**'s life gain per turn reduced 2 → 1.\r\n- **Support Misdirector** no longer scales and just gives a flat three holograms.\r\n- **Ultramagnetic Interference** teleport cost increased 2G → 3G.\r\n- **Lifestrider** now adds G naturally and can filter mana.\r\n- **Back to Work** teleport cost increased 2B → 3B.\r\n- **Salvation Class Warship** can arm any creature.\r\n- **Amlich Consulting** fixed it refering to a \"planeswalker\", whatever that is. It now properly refers to \"organizations\".\r\n- **Matter Redistribution** removed \"his or her\" for \"their\"."}}}
