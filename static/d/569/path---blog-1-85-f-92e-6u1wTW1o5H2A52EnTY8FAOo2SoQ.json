Welcome to my blog. You'll find I'll be talking about all sorts of things, but the one common factor is that I'll be talking about _games_ in almost all of them. I play all sorts of board games and PC games, and a few Nintendo games here and there. Some of my lifetime favourites include (to varying degrees):\r\n\r\n![Magic: the Gathering, Android: Netrunner, Overwatch, Endless Space, Hearthstone, Thomas Was Alone, Undertale, Race for the Galaxy, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Anno 2070, Evil Genius, Fallout: New Vegas, SimCity 4, Shadowrun: Hong Kong, FTL: Faster Than Light, Sid Meier's Civilization, The Sims, Stardew Valley, Stellaris, Power Grid, Kingdom of Loathing, Europa Universalis, Slay the Spire, Team Fortress 2][games]\r\n\r\n_Magic: the Gathering, Android: Netrunner, Overwatch, Endless Space, Hearthstone, Thomas Was Alone, Undertale, Race for the Galaxy, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Anno 2070, Evil Genius, Fallout: New Vegas, SimCity 4, Shadowrun: Hong Kong, FTL: Faster Than Light, Sid Meier's Civilization, The Sims, Stardew Valley, Stellaris, Power Grid, Kingdom of Loathing, Europa Universalis, Slay the Spire, Team Fortress 2_\r\n\r\n[games]: favouriteGames \"Selection of favourites\"\r\n"},{"name":"2019-05-12-temporal-mastery","title":"Temporal Mastery","publishDate":"2019-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"2019-05-12-temporal-mastery","tags":["strategy"],"images":[],"markdown":"# Temporal Mastery\r\n\r\nTempo is the speed at which you are reaching your victory condition compared to your opponent.\r\n\r\nChances are you are going to be an MTG player, so let's start with that. In basic MTG, your victory condition is your opponent's life total reduced to zero. You do this by attacking your opponent with creatures, and your opponent prevents this by blocking with creatures. So when you gain creatures that can connect with the opponent, you are gaining in tempo. This can be as simple as playing a creature with flying; it can also be something like removing one of the opponent's creatures, which then lets your own creatures attack again. Because tempo is relative, the inverse is also true - removing the opponent's creatures to stop them from attacking or playing creatures to block with are both ways to gain tempo as well though it's limited to returning the tempo to parity rather than improving it further and is often framed in terms of defensive speed.\r\n\r\nHowever, your opponent also has the chance to do the same and as such you can imagine they will swing the tempo back to parity. This pattern is very common in games of MTG, with one player always slightly on the front foot, and the other player spending their turns catching up.\r\n\r\nGraph here.\r\n\r\nIf neither player ever runs out of cards in hand, this could go on forever. So what would have to happen for tempo to fully swing in someone's favour? This is the point in the logic where we connect tempo with _mana advantage_.\r\n\r\nThe player who can do these tempo-gaining activities more efficiently is the player who gains more tempo overall. So for example, spending a turn removing your opponent's creature and also playing a creature of your own will gain you tempo if all your opponent is able to do on their next turn is to play an equivalent creature.\r\n\r\nThe great thing about MTG is the number of layers of abstraction the players have developed in order to think about strategy. Notice the difference between the definition of tempo where we talk about life totals and the abstracted discussion of tempo where we talk about mana efficiency. Tempo in MTG has been discussed in detail to death already, so I'm not going to go much further here. Go look up articles written by all sorts of people. "}]}}
