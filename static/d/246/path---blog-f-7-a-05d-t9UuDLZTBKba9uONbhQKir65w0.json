In this weekly blog, we'll travel through the gaming world exploring theory, strategy, and design. I hope you'll find it thought-provoking, and maybe you'll come away seeing games in a different light.\r\n\r\n## Some personal favourites\r\n\r\nBut let's start with a bit about me and what games have influenced my thinking. I've gathered together 24 of my favourite games — obviously it's difficult to get these types of lists correct, especially with something as nebulous as \"favourite\", but it will at least be enlightening and you might discover something new to try.\r\n\r\n![Magic: the Gathering, Android: Netrunner, Overwatch, Endless Space, Hearthstone, Thomas Was Alone, Undertale, Race for the Galaxy, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Anno 2070, Evil Genius, Fallout: New Vegas, SimCity 4, Shadowrun: Hong Kong, FTL: Faster Than Light, Sid Meier's Civilization, The Sims, Stardew Valley, Stellaris, Power Grid, Kingdom of Loathing, Europa Universalis, Slay the Spire, Team Fortress 2][games]\r\n\r\n_You should definitely try these games... or at least read about them._\r\n\r\n### The big 2\r\n\r\nIn [_Magic: the Gathering_](https://magic.wizards.com/), you are powerful mages competing against the others. It's the most popular collectible card game in the world, having its first set of cards released in 1993. Few games can boast such a long history, with players who started decades ago still playing today.\r\n\r\n[_Android: Netrunner_](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android-netrunner-the-card-game/) sees a hacker go up against a faceless corporation in a cyber-noir world through an asymmetrical living card game. First published in 2012, Fantasy Flight Games chose not to renew the license to the Netrunner game rules in 2018 and so they discontinued work on it. However, a volunteer organisation, [Nisei](http://nisei.net/about/nisei/), has taken up the mantle to continue the game for its small but dedicated fan base.\r\n\r\n### The rest (in a random order)\r\n\r\n[_Overwatch_](https://playoverwatch.com/) is a team-based first-person shooter with a growing roster of different characters to choose from.\r\n\r\n[_Endless Space 2_](https://www.endless-space.com/) is part of a series of space-based 4X games set in the Endless universe. It uses divergent factions and empire directions to create a uniquely asymmetric experience.\r\n\r\n[_Hearthstone_](https://playhearthstone.com/) is currently the most popular digital collectible card game in the world. Although it's still going strong, recent forays into DCCGs by competitors have seen it start to slump.\r\n\r\n[_Thomas Was Alone_](http://www.mikebithellgames.com/thomaswasalone/) is a platformer following the story of a collection of shapes. Working with just platforming levels and a narrator, it weaves a story that's so much greater than its parts.\r\n\r\n[_Undertale_](https://undertale.com/) is a role-playing game focused on the choices you make. With very simplistic graphics, it also makes do with very little to create a game that reaches into your soul.\r\n\r\n[_Race for the Galaxy_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy/) is a board game in the \"Euro\" style, with players vying to see who can make the most victory points. It is known point for the symbolism the game uses in its design that, once understood, makes the entire game easy to parse at any point in time.\r\n\r\n[_One Night Ultimate Werewolf_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147949/one-night-ultimate-werewolf/) is a social deduction board game, with villagers trying to ascertain who the werewolves are, and the werewolves trying to avoid detection. It is **not** Werewolf — in ONUW, the game lasts one night only, and a side wins depending on who gets voted to be lynched. It's a fast-paced party game that doesn't leave time for people to become bored or feel sorry for themselves.\r\n\r\n[_Anno 2070_](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/anno-2070/) is part of the _Anno_ series of real-time strategy games, with the focus firmly on management and economics than warfare. In them, you build up increasingly intricate supply chains to fulfil an increasingly demanding populace, all the while competing with the other players for resources and land. (I would advise against playing _Anno 2205_.)\r\n\r\n[_Evil Genius_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3720/Evil_Genius/) is a base-builder published in 2004, where you play as an evil genius trying to take over the world! Created while spy-thrillers were in the height of their popularity, it plays to its theme extremely well.\r\n\r\n[_Fallout: New Vegas_](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/games/fallout-new-vegas/) is a first-person shooter role-playing game set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland as envisioned in the 50s and 60s.\r\n\r\n[_SimCity 4_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/24780/SimCity_4_Deluxe_Edition/) was the last in the line of SimCity series of city-builder games, until its criticised reboot in 2012.\r\n\r\n[_Shadowrun: Hong Kong_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/346940/Shadowrun_Hong_Kong__Extended_Edition/) is part of the Shadowrun RPG games, set in the Shadowrun universe which is a blend of urban fantasy and cyberpunk.\r\n\r\n[_FTL: Faster Than Light_](https://subsetgames.com/ftl.html) is a real-time strategy rogue-like where you control a ship and its crew trying to deliver a message while running from the rebel fleet.\r\n\r\n[_Sid Meier's Civilization_](https://civilization.com/) is up to the sixth iteration in the series now. It's a series of turn-based empire builders, going through the history of human civilization, culminating in a victory by uniting the world in a variety of methods.\r\n\r\n[_The Sims_](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/) is another long-running series, currently on its fourth installment. They're sandbox life simulation games, where you control a Sim or a family of Sims through their lives.\r\n\r\n[_Stardew Valley_](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) is a role-playing farming simulation game. Much likened to the _Harvest Moon_ games of the past, it's a labour of love created by one person.\r\n\r\n[_Stellaris_](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/stellaris/STST01G-MASTER.html) is a real-time strategy space-based empire-builder, where you guide a species starting from its home planet to whatever goal you want, whether it's taking over the galaxy, establishing a galactic peace-keeping force, or ascending to the next plane of existence.\r\n\r\n[_Power Grid_](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2651/power-grid/) is a \"Euro\"-style board game. Players are attempting to be the one powering the most cities. Its mechanics tie together to create a compelling economy among the players.\r\n\r\n[_Kingdom of Loathing_](https://www.kingdomofloathing.com/), started in 2003, is jokingly referred to as a browser-based MSORPG — Massively Singleplayer Online Role-Playing Game. You are an adventurer who roams about the kingdom completing various quests. The game is first and foremost meant to be humerous in nature, with jokes, witticisms, and pop culture references throughout.\r\n\r\n[_Europa Universalis IV_](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/europa-universalis-iv/EUEU04GSK-MASTER.html) is a historical grand strategy game, where you control a nation starting in the 1444 through to 1821. It uses a variety of systems to create a web of relations between nations through trade, diplomacy, and war.\r\n\r\n[_Slay the Spire_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/) is a deck-building rogue-like. You play as one of three characters, and progress through multiple levels deciding what cards to add to your deck in order to defeat the boss at the end.\r\n\r\n[_Team Fortress 2_](http://www.teamfortress.com/) is a hat-simulator. First published in 2007 as a team-based first-person shooter with unique characters that each play and add to their team in different ways, in time it became obvious that a change in direction was needed and it became the hat simulator it's known as today.\r\n\r\n[games]: favouriteGames\r\n"}]}}
