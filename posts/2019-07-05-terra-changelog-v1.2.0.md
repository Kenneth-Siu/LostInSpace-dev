# Terra Changelog v1.2.0

## In this update

- Scry no longer has reminder text.
- Creatures that enter the battlefield and arm themselves changed to just enter the battlefield armed instead of having a trigger. This should make rules more intuitive on the results of arming when the target is removed in response.
- **Theat Profiling** and **CEO Umida Koto** had flavour text changed.
- **Rumors and Whispers** reworded for clarity.
- **Mindmeld Torturer** had flavour text added.
- **Leave Behind** reworked again, and had flavour text added.
- **Rip Space-Time** lost the 2 damage to self, gained an exile clause for creatures, and had its teleport cost increased 1R → 2R.
- **Experimental Mutagenics**'s cost reduced 2G → 1G.
- **Publicity Officer**'s life gain per turn reduced 2 → 1.
- **Support Misdirector** no longer scales and just gives a flat three holograms.
- **Ultramagnetic Interference** teleport cost increased 2G → 3G.
- **Lifestrider** now adds G naturally and can filter mana.
- **Back to Work** teleport cost increased 2B → 3B.
- **Salvation Class Warship** can arm any creature.
- **Amlich Consulting** fixed it refering to a "planeswalker", whatever that is. It now properly refers to "organizations".
- **Matter Redistribution** removed "his or her" for "their".
