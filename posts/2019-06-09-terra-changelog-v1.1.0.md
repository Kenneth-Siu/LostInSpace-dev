# Terra Changelog v1.1.0

## In this update

- Infiltrate/arm color pie adjustments — testing proved even a small amount of overlap is too easily assembled; infiltrate is no longer in white and arm is no longer in black.
- Teleport adjusted in blue and red to make it easier to happen, but in black and green adjusted to make it more difficult.
- Removed ability to grant mutate to creatures so giving mutate to a token doesn't reveal the whole library for teleport.
- A few other minor balance and flavour text tweaks.

## White

- **Head Detective** lost infiltrate and gained hexproof.
- **Mongrel Companion** lost infiltrate and gained "Whenever Mongrel Companion attacks with exactly one other creature, it gains indestructible until end of turn."
